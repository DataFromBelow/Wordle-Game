# Wordle Game
This is like the Wordle game but worse, except it is written in python and currently will be only in commandline.

## Please enjoy or don't
This is meant to be a Python commandline version of the game Wordle. 

I am aware this is a total mess, but for some reason if statements are getting ignored. Normally, i'd have the time to fix it but not right now.

## Getting Started
### Dependencies
- IF you use windows 10, you have to set the path for the Word input (currenty: wordle_ord.txt) to the folder path.
- IF you use windows 11, you have to set the path for the Word input (currenty: wordle_ord.txt) to the relative path.

Do not ask why this is, i don't yet know. See *Known Issues*

### Installing

### Executing Program


## Known Issues
There's currently a problem with some devices requiring relative paths while other devices are configured to simply access what is in the same folder. If i can solve this, i will, though it is proving to be rather interesting.
