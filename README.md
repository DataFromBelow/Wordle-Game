# Wordle Game
This is like the Wordle game, except it is written in python and currently will be only in commandline.

## Please enjoy or don't

I am aware this is a total mess, but for some reason if statements are getting ignored. Normally, i'd have the time to fix it but not right now.

## Known Issues
There's currently a problem with some devices requiring relative paths while other devices are configured to simply access what is in the same folder. If i can solve this, i will.
